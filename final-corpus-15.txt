Some federal jobs allow you to substitute your education for the required experience in order to

substitution of education for experience is permitted.

In addition to the specialized experience, you must also meet the basic education requirement, 
described below. BASIC EDUCATION REQUIREMENT:
1. Degree in architecture; or related field that included 60 semester hours of course work in 
architecture or related disciplines of which at least (1) 30 semester hours were in architectural 
design, and (2) 6 semester hours were in each of the following: structural technology, properties 
of materials and methods of construction, and environmental control systems.

OR

2. Combination of education and experience -- college-level education, training, and/or technical 
experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the arts and sciences underlying professional 
architecture, and (2) a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the architectural 
principles, methods, and techniques and their applications to the design and construction or 
improvement of buildings. The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by at least one of 
the following:

A) Related Curriculum: Degree in architectural engineering may be accepted as satisfying in full 
the basic requirements, provided the completed course work in architectural engineering provided 
knowledge, skills, and  abilities substantially equivalent to those provided in the courses 
specified in paragraph 1. The curriculum for a degree in either architecture or architectural 
engineering covers function, esthetics, site, structure, economics, mechanical- electrical, and 
other engineering problems related to the design and construction of buildings primarily (but not 
exclusively) intended to house human activities. The courses required for a degree in architecture 
generally place emphasis upon planning, esthetics, and materials and methods of construction, while 
the courses for an architectural engineering degree place equal or greater weight on the technical 
engineering aspects such as structural systems, mechanical systems, and the properties of 
materials. Because of this difference in emphasis, persons with degrees in architecture may have a 
preference for work assignments that offer greater opportunities for them to express their artistic 
and creative abilities. As a result, they may be more concerned with planning and design aspects of 
architecture, and persons with degrees in architectural engineering may be more engaged in aspects 
emphasizing technical engineering considerations.

OR

B) Experience: An applicant lacking a degree in architecture must have had l year of experience in 
an architect's office or in architectural work for each year short of graduation from a program of 
study in architecture. In the absence of college courses, 5 years of such experience is required. 
This experience must have demonstrated that the applicant has acquired a thorough knowledge of the 
fundamental principles and theories of professional architecture.

NOTE: You must submit a copy of your transcripts at the time of application.
